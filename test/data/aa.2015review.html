<p>It&rsquo;s that time of year again, so here&rsquo;s another self-indulgent reflection on the last 12 months. I promise to keep it mostly tech-focused this time.</p>
<h2 id="new-technology-for-2015">New Technology for 2015</h2>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of a year in recent memory where I learned so many new technologies. It&rsquo;s no exaggeration that my tools of choice are now completely different than they were just 3 years ago. Of course the rate of churn in the front-end world has been a frequent topic of lamentation this year, but generally I welcome all of the great new ideas and libraries that we have to choose from. Here are my top picks from 2015:</p>
<h3 id="redux">Redux</h3>
<p>Finally, a variant of <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/">Flux</a> that just <em>feels right</em>. I love how beautifully simple the APIs are, and there&rsquo;s a really great community and ecosystem sprouting up around Redux. Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs">conference talk</a> on how it came to be, and the really excellent <a href="https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux">tutorial videos</a>.</p>
<h3 id="eslint">ESLint</h3>
<p>It seems a lot of people are moving from JSHint to <a href="http://eslint.org">ESLint</a>, and it&rsquo;s easy to see why: style checking, pluggable rules, and a really active ecosystem make it by far the best JavaScript linter going forward.</p>
<h3 id="webpack">Webpack</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/">Webpack</a> takes a lot of heat (often deserved) for being a beast to configure, but there really isn&rsquo;t anything comparable for transforming and bundling web assets. And once you experience <a href="https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html">HMR</a> for JavaScript and CSS, writing a web app any other way feels painfully archaic.</p>
<h3 id="flexbox">Flexbox</h3>
<p>I was definitely playing catch-up on this one, but 2015 was finally the year that browser support for CSS&rsquo;s Flexbox made its widespread use feasible. If you write CSS and haven&rsquo;t jumped in yet, check out <a href="https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/">how much easier</a> it&rsquo;ll make your life.</p>
<h3 id="neovim">Neovim</h3>
<p>I moved from Vim to <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim">Neovim</a> this year as my main editor, and it has been remarkably stable for such an ambitious young project. If you use Vim and aren&lsquo;t on an Amiga, I definitely recommend switching, if only for the async command support (check out <a href="https://github.com/benekastah/neomake">Neomake</a>).</p>
<h3 id="react-native">React-Native</h3>
<p>Since November, I have been spending a lot of time with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">react-native</a>. While it is still raw in a lot of ways (particularly the docs), it is already an incredibly powerful platform for building mobile apps. I am constantly stunned by</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p>Looking back on the 39 books I read, there were surprisingly few technical ones last year. Of the half dozen tech books, <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920031123.do">CSS Secrets</a> was <em>by far</em> the best. If you have some experience with CSS, I very highly recommend it. There were a few non-technical standouts as well:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>The Idiot</em> (Dostoevsky) - Not nearly as good as <em>Crime &amp; Punishment</em>, but still worthwhile</li>
  <li><em>Zero to Five</em> - The best parenting book I&rsquo;ve read so far</li>
  <li><em>The Sandman</em> (the full graphic novel series) - A really impressive piece of work</li>
  <li><em>Zen to Done</em> - Another take on <em>Getting Things Done</em>. Still trying to put some of its ideas into practice.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="this-blog">This Blog</h2>
<p>One of my goals for the year was to write a few more things on this blog. While I missed the goal of one entry per month, I eked out <a href="http://mypost.com/posts">8</a>, still far above my usual rate. Though I&rsquo;m not particularly proud of anything I wrote, I am glad that I managed to force some pieces out, just to get the practice. There are no blog-related goals for 2016, so we&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>
