      <description><![CDATA[<p>I first connected to the internet 21 years ago...&nbsp;so I guess this year I've got to go out and buy myself something brass. You know, we're all locked into this crazy relationship for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health...&nbsp;'till death do us part.</p><p>I love you my sweet W.W.W.&nbsp;Absence most certainly makes <em>my </em>heart grow fonder. <em>With you</em> I'm more productive. <em>Without you</em> I'm more productive.&nbsp;This is me without you:</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2 class="text-align-center"><strong>Build it and they will (hopefully) come</strong></h2><h3>Over the last months I've been working on something I'm mighty proud of. I've just come out with a book on WorkFlowy: 99 days, 446 hours and 254 pages later, I've had to draw on a mashup of productivity hacks, including but not limited to, GTD, The Pomodoro Technique, The Eisenhower Matrix, Kanban, "Don't Break the Chain!", "Eat that Frog!" and "Don't Watch that Star Trek!" The last one is my own private productivity hack. I failed at it miserably. Countless times.&nbsp;<br /> </h3><h2 class="text-align-center"><strong>An app is an app, no matter how small</strong></h2><h3>WorkFlowy, as you may well know, is one of those rare finds - an app that you can grow with. Whatever productivity hacks and systems you've got going - each of them can intuitively find their incarnation in WorkFlowy. Then there's the part about writing my entire book in WorkFlowy. Every last word. Every Markdown inline image link. I outline that all in my book.&nbsp;<br /> </h3><h2 class="text-align-center"><strong>One small step for me...</strong></h2><h3>After flipping through my book, Jesse Patel, one of WorkFlowy's co-founders, has invited me to take over the WorkFlowy blog - where I'll be producing content, and more significantly, attempting to rope in other users for their own <em>show and tells</em>. If you're a WorkFlowy fan with something to share, please drop me a line.&nbsp;</h3><h2 class="text-align-center"><strong>With a little help from my friends</strong></h2><h3>If you have just a shred of humanity in you, you will tell everyone you know about my book - today. And if you don't, the productivity gods will bring upon you the debilitating curse of procrastination (in general). You'll see. Or... you could just tell some needy soul about my book out of the goodness of your heart. Either approach will work for me.</h3>

<h3 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1445258964329_59777">More seriously now - if you're a blogger or someone who has any sort of reach and you'd consider giving my book a review, please get in touch with me for a complimentary copy.&nbsp;</h3><h3>And yes,&nbsp;I will be getting back to my regular posts here -&nbsp;that is, if you've missed me.<br>&nbsp;<br><br></h3>]]></description>

It comes from the root word "meta", meaning beyond...&nbsp;[It] refers to the study of memory-monitoring and self-regulation, meta-reasoning,&nbsp;consciousness&nbsp;and self-awareness. In practice these capacities are used to regulate one's own cognition, to maximize one's potential to think,&nbsp;learn&nbsp;and to the evaluation of proper&nbsp;ethical/moral rules.</em>" - Wikipedia</blockquote><p><span>Way back I read an essay on <a target="_blank" href="http://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/10/27/procrastination/">youarenotsosmart.com</a>. It got me thinking in the right direction. It got me <em>thinking about thinking</em>. It got me thinking that it's OK to analyze the crap out of stuff.&nbsp;If you're an overthinker, there's a space for you in this world... and you can hone your thinking into a very powerful impetus for personal change. The abovementioned article deals mostly&nbsp;with procrastination... but the same concepts can also be used to, say, control/ cut down on&nbsp;addictive activities... to really get to yourself.&nbsp;</span><span>Here's an excerpt: </span></p><blockquote><span>"The trick is to accept the&nbsp;<em>now </em>you will not be the person facing those choices, it will be the&nbsp;<em>future&nbsp;</em>you – a person who can’t be trusted. Future-you will give in, and then you’ll go back to being now-you and feel weak and ashamed. Now-you must trick future-you into doing what is right for both parties... allowing now-you to make it impossible for future-you to sabotage your work. Capable psychonauts who <em>think about thinking </em>can get things done not because they have more will power, more drive, but because they know <strong><em>productivity is a game of cat and mouse</em>.</strong>"</span></blockquote><h2 class="text-align-center"><span>Another one bites the dust...</span></h2>

<p><span>Last year I had to make some gut-wrenching decisions. A slew of awesome TV Series were gouging out a more than sizable serving of my time - gutting my productivity and disemboweling my available time.&nbsp;</span><span>Needless to say, the willpower to resist had failed me a bazillion times. The hoards were pressing in on me, grasping for every ounce of waking moment I had.&nbsp;</span><span>I had to wrench myself from my routine, take a step back and <em>think about thinking</em>. What I did - and what I continue to do - is to analyze the hell out of everything that eats into my time unnecessarily. Small example: </span></p><p><span>In culling my TV habits to the bare essentials, one of those that went surprisingly easily and without kicking up too much of a fuss was...&nbsp;"<em>The Walking Dead</em>". Despite the dramatic story of human resilience and the will to survive, along with some first-class skull-crushing makeup artistry, I had to ask myself the question: "<em>Is there hope in a Zombie Apocalypse</em>?" I researched (Googled) at length and came to the conclusion that there was most likely not going to be any light at the end of this tunnel.&nbsp;I like happy endings... so the impetus to continue watching died a sudden death right there and then. I put that particular bloodlust out of its misery -&nbsp;I had gotten to myself. </span></p><h2 class="text-align-center">... And another one down</h2><p><span>I continued down my list of favorite TV Series determined to choose&nbsp;only <em>two&nbsp;</em>that I would keep close -&nbsp;those two that I could not let go of and that would serve me well&nbsp;(the zombie puns continue).&nbsp;I had to get rid of the dead weight.&nbsp;I had to cut my list down to size. I convinced myself one way or another why each of my targets would never live up to my expectations. In so doing, they lost their hold on me. I had cut their legs out from under them. The thought process behind each candidate up for elimination was uniquely different.&nbsp;Thinking things through brought a&nbsp;finality.&nbsp;</span><span>In fending off the drain on my time, I was freeing myself up to live life a whole lot&nbsp;more.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2 class="text-align-center">The right tools for the job</h2><p><span>Thinking about thinking - far from being a useless exercise - has saved me countless precious hours. Also, most of the time it gets the job done right - the first time. You're going to need some tools to spread out your thinking. I recommend a piece of paper, a white board, an app... anything where you can get those vicious thought cycles, those biters, out of your head and map them out. My personal preference is <em>WorkFlowy</em>, a simple yet powerful outliner that helps me to think about thinking... to reason things out to the nth degree... to go deeper and get more granular as I turn over every stone. I hack away at my laptop in a frenzy of keyboard shortcuts -&nbsp;spreading out the arteries of my thought processes -&nbsp;watching as the lifeblood of my procrastination and obsessions lose their pulse -&nbsp;their substance not what it used to be. The deed is done. Reality check - it cannot be unthought.&nbsp;I find closure, archive that WorkFlowy list and move on.</span></p><p><span>Whether it's habits you're trying to kick, procrastination you're trying to beat, confusion you're working through, routines you're trying to establish, conclusions you're trying to reach, decisions you're trying to make, next actions you're trying to determine... whatever it is, <em>thinking about thinking</em> can get you there. You need to have an end goal in mind, or at least a vague sense of one to start out with. PLUS - you're going to need a tool you're comfortable with that helps to rearrange those thoughts and make sense of them. Once it's all out of your mind, there's nowhere for it to hide. You'll be amazed at how easy it is to terminate&nbsp;vicious thought cycles.</span></p><h2 class="text-align-center">Thinking about thinking wins the race&nbsp;</h2><p><span>To cap things off, here's a series of Calvin &amp; Hobbes strips, where Calvin gives his future self a good talking to (and vice versa). It's this <em>thinking about thinking</em> that won the day over for Calvin in the end. You'll see... Flip through the (14!) comic strips by hitting the right arrow button. (My apologies email subscribers!)</span></p>

      <description>As it turns out, there are a couple of things we can do to keep these 
transient visitors with us at least a tad longer... and then grab them for 
posterity (or better still, collect them for real actionable projects). 
Wait... are we talking about bubbles or ideas here? There are actually best 
practices for making bubbles, in case you didn't know, which include: the 
right timing and atmospheric conditions, plus the right tools. A couple of 
pointers from the same site, which will help to offset evaporation and 
dryness:</description>

<p>Is this a picture of what happens to your <em>brainwave ideas</em>? Does the fragile membrane of their existence&nbsp;disintegrate, barely allowing you the chance to entertain them, let alone capture them, <span>before they are no more</span>?</p><p>My quest to find out why bubbles pop - and if there was anything we could do to prolong their stay with us - was an enlightening and <span>ephemeral</span>&nbsp;journey.&nbsp;A Google search&nbsp;instantly&nbsp;bubbled <a target="_blank" href="http://bubbles.org/html/questions/pop.htm">bubbles.org</a>&nbsp;to the top.</p><p><span>Among the reasons why bubbles&nbsp;burst:&nbsp;evaporation of their water content and dryness in general&nbsp;(in all its shapes and forms) are the main culprits. In the image below, which I <em>delicately </em>lifted from bubbles.org, you can see with your very own eyes that even a nail does not pop a bubble when puncturing it - if one such nail&nbsp;is wet.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2 class="text-align-center">Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket...</h2><p>As it turns out, there are a couple of things we can do to keep these transient visitors with us at least a tad longer... and then grab them for posterity (or better still, collect them&nbsp;for real actionable projects). Wait... are we talking about bubbles or ideas here?&nbsp;<em>There are actually best practices for making bubbles</em>, in case you didn't know, which include: the right timing and atmospheric conditions, plus the right tools. A couple of pointers from the same site, which will help to offset evaporation and dryness:</p><ul><li><p>"<em>Try making bubbles right after the sun sets.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Play with bubbles after a rainstorm.&nbsp;When the air is full of moisture, bubbles will seemingly last forever.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Keep you bubble tools really wet with bubble solution.</em>"</p></li></ul><p>The <em>when </em>and <em>where </em>of&nbsp;getting into the zone or finding your creative flow&nbsp;are beyond the scope of this brief post. What I <em>would&nbsp;</em>like&nbsp;to put out are a couple of <em>tools </em>that get the job done for me: at the very least, capturing your ideas with a minimum of fuss and expanding on those ideas at the time of inspiration, if possible. You see, the right tool can be like a bubble gun... or a well-developed bubble-blowing technique that yields the most bubbles per blow. A proliferation of associated ideas and the ability to grab them&nbsp;is a great combination.</p><p>Grabbing actual real, live bubbles and archiving them is beyond the scope of bubble blowing, unless we're talking about taking a <em>snapshot</em>. By recording your ideas while they are in play and still up for grabs, you're basically taking a snapshot of your <em>brainchildren </em>(I know...&nbsp;the plural&nbsp;sounds funny)... and then just by getting the idea(s) out of your mind and into a decent capture system, the proliferation is unavoidable.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="text-align-center">An app for all seasons</h2><p>Now, if I were famous or some sort of productivity guru (or both), you'd probably take the following list -&nbsp;<span>of tried and tested tools I use to capture my ideas -&nbsp;</span>more seriously... So in my defense, and in the spirit of full disclosure, I'm going to have to tell you that I am a kick-butt harmonica player (for what it's worth). Anyways, here goes:</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="https://workflowy.com/">WorkFlowy</a><ul><li>Outliner supreme, giving you one sublime "zoomable" document</li></ul></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egCKZHsICm8">Gingko</a>&nbsp;<ul><li>My writing app of choice, Gingko is the only tree-based word processor.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapentry-fast-diary-journal/id755777893?mt=8">SnapEntry</a> (iOS)<ul><li>Lightning-speed entry to Evernote with the ability to preset notebook destination and/or tags</li></ul></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://evernote.com/penultimate/">Penultimate</a><ul><li>Evernote's iOS app which I use for freehand writing and the drawing of simple&nbsp;mind maps</li></ul></li></ul><p>You'll find much about WorkFlowy, Evernote and Gingko within the pages of this blog... and much more to come. The thing that all of these apps have in common, is the ability to quickly capture <em>and </em>spread your ideas out. In spreading your ideas out, particularly WorkFlowy and Gingko do a bang up job of helping to reorder, reshuffle and then hone in on ideas as you drill down further... and then equally as important, pinpoint&nbsp;your ideas when you need them - whether it's to finally harvest your ideas for the chapters of a&nbsp;book or to remember the ingredients that worked out rather nicely&nbsp;the last time you made pancakes.&nbsp;</p><p>Without decent capture tools, there are going to be a lot of forgotten bubbles... and unsung ideas. Find a good fit, whatever it is, and grab those ideas. If you have any words of wisdom, please capture them below in the comments.</p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>The more one indulges in science fiction, the more one engages in the 
willing suspension of disbelief... and carries the same "impossible" 
technological concepts over into reality - at least for a few seconds, 
while one adjusts to the painful absence of such things as cargo bay 
transporters. But surely there's some sort of technology out there we can 
really sink our teeth into... something that will make a mammoth task just 
a tad less mammoth-like?</description>

<p>Moving house is a pain in the butt during the rainy season in the Northeast of Brazil. Last week I had to get my worldly possessions from one apartment to another. It is no less of an organizational and physical challenge moving a mere 4 blocks down the road.&nbsp;More than&nbsp;once I caught myself contemplating the convenience of the&nbsp;<em>Star-Trek-style transporters - s</em>ay <em>that </em>3 times.&nbsp;Would you turn down the opportunity to beam your&nbsp;inanimate objects&nbsp;over to your new abode?</p><p>The more one indulges in science fiction, the more one engages in the&nbsp;<em>willing suspension of disbelief</em>...&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>carries&nbsp;the same "impossible" technological&nbsp;concepts over into reality -&nbsp;at least for a few seconds, while one adjusts to the painful absence of such things as <em>cargo bay transporters</em>. But surely there's some sort of technology out there we can really sink our teeth into... something that will make a mammoth task just a tad less mammoth-like?</p><h2 class="text-align-center">Back to life, back to reality&nbsp;</h2><p>So when it dawns on you that you'll have to buckle down and use some elbow grease here on planet earth in the 21st century, the next recourse is an app of some sort. Even if it were possible to dematerialize your stuff and materialize it clear across the city, inevitably you're still going to have to do some brain-wracking:&nbsp;"<em>Let's see... I'm going to need to create a mega list of most of my possessions and organize them into discrete contexts that I can act upon.&nbsp;How do I do this systematically, room by room -&nbsp;yet also be able to easily view that same list according to specific categories, such as the things that I want to throw out, the things I need to disassemble, donate, measure, etc?</em>"&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>I created my main list: "<em>ROOM BY ROOM</em>"</li><li><p>Under the main list, I thought of all the actions or decisions I might have had&nbsp;to take and created a corresponding <strong><em>list of</em>&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>tags</strong> </em>under the header by setting up a note (That way my list of tags appears just below the list title without creating a bullet point):&nbsp;<em><span>#<span>Disassemble</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>#<span>Leave</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>#Sell</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>#Donate</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>#Fix</span><span> </span><span>#Clean</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>#Trash&nbsp;</span><span>#Wtf</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>#Sort</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>#Measure</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>#Paint</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>#<span>Now</span></span></em></p></li><li>Next, a separate list for each room:&nbsp;Exercise room, Bathroom, Living room, etc.&nbsp;</li><li>Under each sublist of different areas of the apartment, I listed furniture and the general contents of closets and boxes, etc.&nbsp;<ul><li>Alongside each item, I included an appropriate tag or set of tags... and thereunder, when&nbsp;required, a measurement.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 class="text-align-center">Hunting and gathering</h2><p>Once&nbsp;I got my list down, I could then&nbsp;go ahead and hit any of the tags just below the main list title. WorkFlowy then filters by tag, gathering like tags dispersed across your sublists. In so doing, I was able to batch my tasks and focus on like tasks one at a time... <em>and </em>still have them listed by&nbsp;room. You can drill down to&nbsp;more specifics if you give your items&nbsp;more than one tag and subsequently filter by 2 or more of those tags, i.e. <strong>#Disassemble + #Donate + #Now</strong>.</p>

      <description>Many great things come in twos. There's Laurel and Hardy, Tom and 
Jerry, your smartphone and its charger, sugar and spice (not including all 
things nice)... and then there's Gneo and Evernote. Just like Bonnie and 
Clyde, these two get along like a house on fire. They've got notebooks and 
tags in common. That's a good start. Gneo (for iOS) offers one of the best 
visual experiences possible when it comes to extrapolating your Evernote 
tasks to a 3rd-party app. Plus... it's one of the most 
minimalistically beautiful/ beautifully minimalistic apps I've had the

<h2 class="text-align-center">Twos</h2><p>Many great things come in twos. There's Laurel and Hardy, Tom and Jerry,&nbsp;your smartphone&nbsp;and its charger, sugar and spice (not including all things nice)... and then there's <em>Gneo and Evernote.</em>&nbsp;Just like <span>Bonnie and Clyde, these two&nbsp;</span>get along like a house on fire. They've got notebooks and tags in common. That's&nbsp;a good start.&nbsp;<span>Gneo (for iOS) offers one of the best visual experiences possible when it comes to extrapolating your Evernote tasks to a 3rd-party app. Plus... it's one of the most minimalistically</span><span>&nbsp;beautiful/ beautifully minimalistic apps I've had the pleasure of using</span><span>.</span></p><h2 class="text-align-center">De do do do, de da da da&nbsp;</h2><p>Gneo, is the Irish word for "<em>do</em>". Quite fitting for a task-management app. If you're familiar with the Eisenhower Matrix which was popularized by the late Stephen Covey in his book, "The 7 habits of Highly Effective People." The Eisenhower Matrix is one of the greats in the area of prioritization. I sometimes like to call it the Covey Quadrant... but it was his forerunner, Dwight D. Eisenhower, who mouthed the words,&nbsp;<em>"<a target="_blank" href="http://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/05/09/urgent/">What Is Important Is Seldom Urgent and What Is Urgent Is Seldom Important</a>" </em>It's not the <em>only </em>prioritization method - but it is a darn good one in balancing your life's priorities.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-align-center">Some tasks are "more equal&nbsp;than others"</h2><p>I'm not going to run through the 4 quadrants and what they all mean, except to say that once you've got a basic working knowledge of the underlying principles, one can't ignore your <em>quadrant 2 </em>priorities staring you in the face. A constant reminder that there are truly important things in life - the activities that enrich our lives. The things we invest in that pay off in the long term.&nbsp;Those things are seldom urgent, but we need them to nudge at us. We need them "top right" of our field of vision. <em>That's where Gneo's got you covered</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>If you've got more time on your hands than you know what to do with,&nbsp;I go into more detail in a guest post on the <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.gneo.co/post/82691066396/gneo-gtd-kanban-pomodoro">Gneo blog</a>.</p>

<p>As you can see from the above list,&nbsp;you authorize Gneo to fully integrate with the notebooks, notes and tags within a <em>Gneo stack</em> in your Evernote account. Changes you make in either of the two apps are reciprocal. Besides any number of tags you can apply to your tasks, whenever you drag and drop tasks from one quadrant to another in your Eisenhower Matrix (in Gneo), the tags will automatically reshuffle to reflect the Urgent and Important categories your tasks are in. A beautiful thing to behold.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-align-center">In a nutshell</h2><ul><li>Gneo's tasks are the equivalent of Evernote notes&nbsp;</li><li>Gneo, too, has notebooks -&nbsp;each of which show up in Evernote&nbsp;as notebooks</li><li>The sum total of your Gneo tasks fit like hand in glove into a Gneo stack in Evernote</li><li>Tags will be tags</li></ul><p>In very much the same way that I set up <a target="_blank" href="http://www.productivitymashup.com/blog/2014/10/16/kanban-calendar-evernote-series-2-of-5">Kanban Calendar using the Reminders list in Evernote</a>, in Gneo we'll have a set of about 40 notebooks to cover the 3 Kanban Calendar sections:</p><ol><li>A notebook for each of your Project/ Backlogged sections</li><li>Just one&nbsp;notebook for the "Today" section<ul><li>... since in one fell swoop it includes the 4 matrix priorities, <em>plus </em>tasks can be checked off (Done stage of our Kanban Calendar)</li></ul></li><li>A notebook for each of the 30+ up-and-coming days<ul><li>We'll also slip in a&nbsp;"<em>Smart Notebook</em>" (which is pretty smart) -&nbsp;more about that in a bit.</li></ul></li></ol><p> </p><iframe scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/aztCvPlVtHc?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" width="640" frameborder="0" height="480">
</iframe><p> </p><p>Just as I promised in the previous post, in the following video clips&nbsp;I've included&nbsp;scores from another of Charlie Chaplin's silent movies "<em>The Kid</em>" (1921) .</p><p>In this&nbsp;1st video I'll give you a quick overview of:</p><ol><li>A list of the notebooks in both Gneo and Evernote</li><li>The Matrix interface in Gneo, together with a List View thereof</li><li>&nbsp;Dragging and dropping tasks within a Matrix in Gneo and the subsequent tag reshuffling in Evernote (after a sync)</li></ol><p> </p><p> </p><iframe scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/s7AgCM3QdrQ?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" width="640" frameborder="0" height="480">
</iframe><p> </p><p>In the&nbsp;2nd video you'll see how you can...</p><ul><li>Check tasks off (which I forgot to include in the 1st video)</li><li>Create/ edit a "Smart Notebook":&nbsp;Smart Notebooks allow us to filter any selection of notebooks by certain parameters, including due dates, tags, etc. At its simplest, we can include any combination of notebooks to form a new context. I find it handy to be able to view a combination of notebooks for between&nbsp;3-7&nbsp;of the next days&nbsp;ahead. You simply check/ uncheck the notebooks from the notebook list that you want to include/ exclude while editing your Smart Notebook.&nbsp;</li></ul><p> </p><h2 class="text-align-center">Then there's that</h2><p>Gneo and Evernote sync rather nicely. Especially if you want your tasks to be searchable in Evernote. Another interesting thing&nbsp;one can do with Gneo is piggyback on Evernote and&nbsp;use IFTTT recipes to send data to a specific notebook in the Gneo stack in Evernote... which will in turn&nbsp;sync to the Gneo app itself. You can also send emails through to Gneo using your Evernote email address - if you include a notebook within the Gneo stack in your email subject line or use the Evernote web clipper in Gmail accordingly.&nbsp;</p><p>There are many brilliant features that are part of Gneo's toolbox which I have not so much as&nbsp;hinted at, such as calendar integration (including a whole calendar view), a host of swiping gestures to postpone tasks and access the editing menu to include notes,&nbsp;location, reminders, file attachments, audio and more. Not to forget&nbsp;the search feature which one can use to filter for keywords and tags.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're big on the Eisenhower Matrix and you're determined to have your tasks in Evernote too, Gneo is the best way to view those tasks in an intuitive and palatable way...&nbsp;<span>so, by all means, explore Gneo for yourself.&nbsp;</span></p><hr />]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Swipes - Evernote Kanban Calendar (5a)</title>
      <dc:creator>Frank Degenaar</dc:creator>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2015 22:15:15 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>http://www.productivitymashup.com/blog/2015/1/5/swipes-and-evernote</link>

      <description>As a follow-on from last week's intro into the degree of control/ 
integration that 3rd-party apps can and can't have using Evernote's open 
API, this post skims the surface of how the Swipes app can do what many 
people have been asking Evernote for: the ability to extract checkbox items 
within notes account-wide to a dedicated task-management interface. That 
wish list also included the ability to reorder tasks with checkboxes 
arbitrarily within a list.  Swipes has got you covered on both counts. 
You'll find Swipes on iOS, Android and Web. </description>

<p>Of course, you could directly search your&nbsp;Evernote account for notes that have checkbox items in whatever context you're in - whether in "All Notes",&nbsp;a stack, notebook, tag context, etc. Here is the search syntax:</p><ul><li><strong>todo:*</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;All notes with checkboxes&nbsp;</li><li><strong>todo:false</strong>&nbsp;- &nbsp;All notes with&nbsp;unchecked checkboxes</li><li><strong>todo:true</strong> - All notes which have checked checkboxes</li></ul><p><span><em>However, as already mentioned, for those who are into simple lists with checkboxes,&nbsp;Evernote does not&nbsp;allow for much wiggle room in the way&nbsp;of&nbsp;easily reshuffling them around within a note as well as grouping them&nbsp;together on one interface.</em>&nbsp;On the other hand, the Swipes app drills into your notes to harvest the checkbox&nbsp;items therein -&nbsp;No more, no less. You can then&nbsp;</span>group those tasks together in any arbitrary&nbsp;order you wish within Swipes.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you've connected the Swipes&nbsp;app to your Evernote account, there are a few ways to skin this cat and sync your tasks to Evernote:</p><ol><li><span>Through the "<em>Integration</em>" section, you have a couple of options:</span><ul><li>You can open the Evernote Importer and import individual notes of your choice.</li><li>You can activate an option to auto import any notes in your account&nbsp;with the<em> <strong>"Swipes" tag.&nbsp;</strong></em>I like this option.</li></ul></li><li>You can create a new task and from within the&nbsp;task interface itself, import the checkboxes from any Evernote note(s).&nbsp;</li></ol><p>In each of the above cases, Swipes takes the checkboxed tasks&nbsp;from each note and creates subtasks, which they call&nbsp;<em>"action steps"</em> within one main task in Swipes. At the top level, one simply has tasks in Swipes and one cannot categorize further, apart from reordering your list... so the grouping together of discrete task categories needs to be according to what is contained in an Evernote note...</p><p>With this in mind,&nbsp;the <em>note titles</em>&nbsp;in Evernote become our Kanban stages in Swipes, each containing their subtasks/ action steps (checkboxes within a note). You will notice below that to recreate our kanban sections in Swipes, one can create a new task which simply serves as a <em>placeholder&nbsp;</em>for&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Backlogged</em>,&nbsp;<em>Today</em>, &nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Calendar </em>sections -&nbsp;and from there, you would group your stages under each of the 3 sections, which you will see in the video clip a little further down. The "Today" section is pictured below.</p>

<p>When you tap on any task in Swipes, it will show you a list of its action steps therein. If you slide an action step&nbsp;to complete it, it will be checked off in the corresponding Evernote note too. It's a reciprocal thing: What you check off or create in one app will sync and affect a change in the other. However, in Swipes, if you delete any task or action step, it will not delete its contemporary in Evernote. One cannot&nbsp;delete an Evernote checkbox task&nbsp;through Swipes - only modify it. Which is a good thing, considering that often a checkbox&nbsp;may be part of a larger context within an&nbsp;Evernote note, which may contain other relevant information besides checkbox items. Another thing one can do in Swipes is <em>reorder your action steps&nbsp;</em>by dragging and dropping, which in an Evernote note can only be achieved through a cut-and-paste method.</p>

      <description>One of the handy things about Evernote is that there numerous (possibly 
gazillions) of onramps - tons of ways of getting stuff into your account. 
Not only that, but there are literally thousands of apps out there that you 
can authorize to access your Evernote account and send/ harvest/ hone in 
on/ extract specific information, and in many cases allow for a 2-way sync. 
In the weeks to come, I will be showcasing 5 3rd-party Evernote apps that 
do a spectacular (if not totally unique) job of managing your tasks - in 
Kanban Calendar fashion.</description>

<p>The Borg, from the Star Trek franchise, were a collection of species from different planets that had been turned into cybernetic beings to form a pseudo-race. The Borg forced other species into their "hive mind" through a process of assimilation, and in an episode I watched,&nbsp;forewarned&nbsp;the Starship Enterprise: "<em>Resistance is futile.&nbsp;We wish to improve ourselves,&nbsp;to have your biological and&nbsp;technological distinctiveness. Y<span>our culture will adapt&nbsp;</span></em><span><em>to service ours.</em>" -&nbsp;<em>The Next Generation,&nbsp;S03E26</em>.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span>The Evernote API does not allow such a degree of access to 3rd-party apps so as&nbsp;assimilate and fully control your account to its detriment. The relationship is a whole lot more mutual and benign. A win-win setup. The relationship&nbsp;between a 3rd-party app and&nbsp;Evernote&nbsp;leverages the other's technological distinctiveness, as we will see in coming posts.&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p>Through the assimilation of a range of technologies&nbsp;and knowledge, the Borg came to be&nbsp;among the most powerful&nbsp;entity&nbsp;in the galaxy.</p><p><strong>Evernote would not be half as powerful if it were not for its integrating with so many darn good apps, some of which may even be seen as extensions of Evernote. I'll bet&nbsp;you could list a dozen apps off the top of your head that integrate with Evernote. Imagine a digital world with none of that connectivity...</strong></p><p><span>The Borg comprised a population of&nbsp;<em>drones&nbsp;</em>and had technologies&nbsp;integrated into their bodies which enabled them to function&nbsp;within the Collective.&nbsp;</span><span>A&nbsp;<em>neural transceiver, </em>a</span><span>&nbsp;device that was implanted in the upper spinal column, granted&nbsp;access to an individual's&nbsp;brain and kept&nbsp;</span><span>them connected to the&nbsp;hive mind</span><span>.</span></p><p><strong>When two apps&nbsp;sync via the cloud to one another, it's a beautiful thing. More often than not, there is a seamless back and forth of information exchange, no matter what device you're syncing from. They're all in communication, just&nbsp;running in the background.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span>In the case of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, who was assimilated into the Collective (designated Locutus of Borg) and who&nbsp;was their intended spokesperson for the assimilation of the&nbsp;</span><span>human race, it took the annihilation of a Borg Cube to disconnect him from the hive mind.</span></p><p><strong>In a less dramatic fashion, if one wanted to disconnect any 3rd-party app&nbsp;from Evernote, it would simply mean going along to your <em>Account P</em><em>age </em>and under "<em>Applications</em>" you could revoke their access&nbsp;individually. Quick and painless.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>After assimilation a drone had no sense of individuality and served only the Collective.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In the next 5 posts, we'll be taking a few Evernote 3rd-party apps for a test drive. Each app has it's own personality (whether big or small) and unique&nbsp;distinctiveness. You may just latch onto one or more that help&nbsp;you to figure out a workflow&nbsp;unique to you.&nbsp;</strong></p><hr />]]></content:encoded>

<p>R&amp;R is very much underrated: we needs periods of renewal - to&nbsp;recharge our batteries and find inspiration. Our downtime may come in both smaller and larger doses.&nbsp;<span>Often we all need a reminder of what we already know. So let's throw back a couple of decades and learn a thing or two from the likes of Star Trek's Captain Jean-Luc Picard,&nbsp;Lieutenant Commander Data and their escapades on the&nbsp;holodeck.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="text-align-center">Captain Jean-Luc Picard</h2><p>(As you&nbsp;all know),&nbsp;a&nbsp;holodeck&nbsp;is a <em><span>Holographic Environment Simulator</span></em> located on&nbsp;starships&nbsp;and&nbsp;starbases, used&nbsp;<span>for recreation, training, and investigative purposes. I'm more so interested in the recreational side of things this time 'round. Remember how Jean-Luc Picard indulged in his childhood fascination with&nbsp;private investigator&nbsp;</span>Dixon Hill, as the holodeck recreated a 1941 San Francisco for Picard to take on the role of his hero? This was his way of disengaging from the overwhelming responsibilities that came with being the captain of Starfleet's flagship vessel.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-align-center">Lieutenant Commander Data</h2><p>Remember our intriguing android, Data, with his endless quest to become more human, and especially to understand what humor was? In&nbsp;"<em>The Outrageous Okona</em>", Season 2, Episode 4 (TNG),<span>&nbsp;Data uses the holodeck to generate a comedy club setting complete with an audience, where he tries his hand at being a&nbsp;stand-up comedian. On more than one occasion, Data uses the holodeck to explore these all-too-elusive&nbsp;human qualities and other existential questions. Here too, being an android that needs no rest, he finds a better environment for introspection and exploration.</span></p><p><span>Where is it... or what is it that allows <em>you </em>to disengage from life's pressures and&nbsp;responsibilities?</span></p>

<p> </p><p>Remember <em>Dale Carnegie</em>? He could have been the fictitional Dixon Hill's contemporary. Here's a piece of his wisdom:</p><blockquote><span>"... to prevent fatigue...&nbsp;the first rule is: Rest often. Rest before you get tired."</span></blockquote><p>Pretty straightforward - but how does that play out in practical terms? Here are a couple of (classical) perspectives:</p><h2 class="text-align-center">Throw in a Pomodoro or two&nbsp;</h2><p>Ever heard of the Pomodoro Technique? At it's simplest, it's a time-boxing routine where one eliminates all distractions and focuses intensively on a task for a period of, say, 25 minutes... followed by a 5-minute break. One repeats this, and at the completion of a 4th Pomodoro, takes a 15-minute break. You should give it a try. Not only are the brief periods of disengagement a way of renewing one's focus - but also, very importantly, one is sufficiently disengaged to evaluate whether what you are working on is in fact a top priority or the most worthwhile activity you can be doing right now. Perspective. Productivity. Efficiency.</p><h2 class="text-align-center">"Life is a series of sprints"</h2><p><span>Here are some quotes from a game-changing&nbsp;book I've been reading,"<em>The&nbsp;Power of Full Engagement - Managing Energy, Not Time, Is the Key to High Performance and Personal Renewal":</em></span></p><ul><li><em>We must learn to live our lives as a series of sprints –&nbsp;<strong>fully engaging for periods of time</strong>,&nbsp;</em><em><strong>and then fully disengaging and seeking renewal&nbsp;</strong>before jumping back into the fray to face whatever challenges confront us.</em></li><li><em><span>To maintain a powerful pulse in our lives, we must learn how to<strong> rhythmically spend and </strong><strong>renew </strong>energy.</span></em></li><li><em><span><strong>Balancing stress and recovery</strong> is critical not just in competitive sports, but also in managing energy in all facets of our lives.</span></em></li></ul><h2 class="text-align-center"><span>Not Urgent and Important</span></h2><p>Don't tell me that you haven't heard of the Eisenhower Matrix, which the late Stephen Covey popularized in his book, "<em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.</em>" Basically, quadrant II includes all of those activities related to the habit of "<em>Sharpening your&nbsp;Saw</em>". What does it mean to sharpen your saw? Basically,&nbsp;anything that will help you <em><strong>renew your energy</strong></em> and keep you balanced.&nbsp;It means having a balanced program for self-renewal in the four areas of your life: physical, social/emotional, mental, and spiritual.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>I regularly take a little time out to do some slacklining, where traversing a cord strung between two trees requires one to put your stress aside in favor of a balancing act.</li><li>Have you ever tried a full P90X workout? I'm not sure about you, but it's near impossible for me to have my worries uppermost in mind as I'm engaged in a series of Crunchy Frogs, Pfiefer Scissors and Mason&nbsp;twists - a sampling of the&nbsp;Ab Ripper X.</li><li>I daily set aside a "<em>Pomodoro</em>" to read a book, similar to a few already mentioned. This gives me perspective and inspiration. It's invigorating. This way I can comfortably get through at least two powerhouse books a month.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class="text-align-center">Thinking Thursdays</h2><p><a target="_blank" href="http://blog.gingkoapp.com/essays/why-i-take-a-week-off-every-7th">Here's a post </a>by a friend of mine, the creator of <a target="_blank" href="https://gingkoapp.com">Gingko app</a>, Adriano Ferrari. He writes about why he takes a week off every 7th. How many of us can actually do that? I can't... but... there are a number of lessons to be learned from the principle. It can be extended to "<em>Thinking Thursdays</em>", where Adriano blocks off a 90-minute period first thing in the morning&nbsp;to think through any number of challenges.&nbsp;</p><p>Now - just to get my hands on an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-signs-the-oculus-rift-is-going-to-be-a-storming-success/">Oculus Rift</a>... the closest one can currently&nbsp;get to a holodeck experience.</p><hr />]]></content:encoded>

<p>When one tags a note (or in this case a task) with more than one tag, that note takes on a super power - the ability to be in <em>more than one place at the same time</em>. Kind of like "<em><strong>The Force". </strong>If this is too cheesy for you: hit the space bar once (on desktop).&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>For those Star Wars fans: An extract from the Star Wars Wiki:</em></p><p><em><strong>The Force</strong>&nbsp;was a metaphysical, spiritual, omnipotent and ubiquitous&nbsp;power&nbsp;that held enormous importance for both the&nbsp;Jedi&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sith&nbsp;monastic orders</em>...&nbsp;<em>Though the Force was thought to flow through every living thing, its power could only be harnessed by beings described as "Force-sensitive." This Force-sensitivity was correlated with, and sometimes attributed to, a high count of internal microorganisms called&nbsp;</em><strong>midi-chlorians</strong><em>&nbsp;that were found in a Force-sensitive's blood: <strong>the higher the count, the greater the being's potential Force ability.</strong></em></p><p>By the way, "<em>ubiquitous</em>" is a fancy word I learned a little over a year ago - meaning "<em>to be present or found everywhere</em>". For our purposes here, <strong><em>I would liken tags in Evernote to these midi-chlorians:</em>&nbsp;<em>The higher the count, the more "contexts" your notes/ tasks can be found in</em></strong>.</p><h2 class="text-align-center">Nothing to show... just a few things to tell</h2>

<p><span>Lately I have done a lot of tinkering with tags. I did my homework... I swear! But I'm going to have to pull a Calvin on you and just do the&nbsp;</span><em>telling&nbsp;</em><span>part this time 'round - apart from the accompanying image of the nested tag hierarchy.</span></p>

<p>In its essence, t<span>he basic tag structure setup here is a mirror image of&nbsp;</span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.productivitymashup.com/blog/2014/10/16/kanban-calendar-evernote-series-2-of-5"><em><strong>P</strong></em><em><strong>art 2</strong></em></a><span>&nbsp;in this series - in other words, each tag context seen here, is an exact replicate of its stack/ notebook counterpart, containing the same tasks. Except that the <em>BACKLOGGED</em>, <em>TODAY</em>&nbsp;and CALENDAR<em>&nbsp;</em>tags are simply place holders&nbsp;under which to nest (drag and drop) the component <em>section</em>, <em>priority&nbsp;</em>and <em>date tags</em>. They do not contain any notes - they are there simply to create structure.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Before I go any further (and this might be an anticlimax to many) -&nbsp;the previously mentioned advantage&nbsp;of using tags to have a task appear in more than one context,&nbsp;is pretty much redundant (or very minimal) here. Sorry to get you all excited about it and then drop a bomb on you. I say this for one simple reason: if you've been following how I set Kanban Calendar up in a variety of wildly different apps -&nbsp;by now you will have caught on that <strong><em>the actual strength&nbsp;of this system lies in&nbsp;any particular task only really appearing&nbsp;in one context</em></strong>. To have a task appear in more than one main context would detract from what makes it such a low-maintenance, fuss-free system.</p><p>You see, any reference material you may have in Evernote is a completely different ball game:&nbsp;You may wish to tag various kinds of documents, web-clippings, ideas, etc. with multiple tags, which would be very helpful indeed - but when it comes to <em>tasks</em>, other than having "GTD"&nbsp;contexts similar to @desktop, @store, @home, etc. &nbsp;(which are secondary contexts) &nbsp;it's best to keep it simple and have a task in one context. In fact the Kanban Calendar structure intuitively strips all of that duplicity&nbsp;away.&nbsp;</p><p>When we consider a huge core concept of Kanban -&nbsp;"<em>Visualize your workflow</em>" -&nbsp;in so far as a single task relates to all others, it is helpful to have it appear in just one&nbsp;place when looking at the scope of your tasks - the bird's-eye view.</p><h2 class="text-align-center">The dark side of the Force&nbsp;</h2><p>When <em>compared </em>with the Notebook/ Reminders list setup&nbsp;in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.productivitymashup.com/blog/2014/10/16/kanban-calendar-evernote-series-2-of-5"><em><strong>Part 2</strong></em></a>, here are some notable minuses of the tagging dynamic:</p><ul><li>When moving a task from one <em>category</em>, <em>priority </em>or <em>date context&nbsp;</em>to another, one <em>not only </em>needs to drag and drop a task to a new tag (or&nbsp;tag it as such on mobile devices - from within a note) - <strong><em>one also needs to un-tag the previous tag</em></strong>, lest the task fall&nbsp;under conflicting dates,&nbsp;priorities etc... or simply for the purpose of archiving. One has to have the proper tagging protocol in place. On the other hand, when a task is moved from one notebook to another, that involves one action - the deed is done.</li><li>As far as I know, one is only able to view this<em> nested tag structure</em> on Desktop clients and Android. It is not (nor may ever be)&nbsp;available on iOS or the new Web Beta. So just keep in mind that <strong><em>nesting tags&nbsp;is not possible&nbsp;on all Evernote clients</em></strong>.</li><li>One <strong><em>cannot arbitrarily reorder/ shuffle tasks</em></strong> as can be done in all other setups&nbsp;in this series.</li></ul><h2 class="text-align-center">The light side of the Force</h2><ul><li>If it's a toss-up specifically between a notebook-based setup and a tag-based setup - remember that the Kanban Calendar system (Reminders list setup)&nbsp;may require up to<span>&nbsp;50 notebooks&nbsp;out of a max of a 250-personal-notebook&nbsp;limit (mainly due to the calendar section). If you're going with tags,<em><strong> there's a 100,000 tag limit</strong></em>. This may be the determining factor if you're running low on notebooks!</span></li><li>One can easily show notes (tasks) from&nbsp;<em><strong>multiple tag contexts together in the Note List</strong></em>. It is easiest on the desktop clients, where one can select any tag combinations in the Left Panel:<ul><li><em>Ctrl-click-click-click </em>(Windows Desktop)... AND then add the "<strong>any:</strong>" syntax <span>to the search bar after the string of tags&nbsp;</span>. This will include all notes from all tag contexts chosen.</li><li>You can then "<em>Sort notes by"</em>&nbsp;&gt; "<em>Tags"&nbsp;</em>in the Note List sorting options:&nbsp;Tasks with the same tags are grouped together.</li><li>One can set any specific combination of tags up as a <em>saved search</em>, making that&nbsp;search&nbsp;more accessible on mobile devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>One can<em><strong> batch tag/un-tag </strong></em>multiple notes (on desktop).</li><li><span>You may already be comfortable and well-acclimated to a tag-based system for task management&nbsp;- and so it would be a natural extension of the system you already have in place if you're a fan of tagging.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p>One final point to ponder:&nbsp;all other setups may <em>also </em>use tags as a layer on top of the existing setup - if one so chooses.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, for those crazed Evernote gurus out there - please, please, please -&nbsp;add to the above lists anything I may have overlooked...&nbsp;or even a different perspective (as tagging relates to the Kanban Calendar system). Something more to this, there's got to be!</p><hr />]]></content:encoded>

      <description>A digital canvas for your imagination

In this digital day and age, many people still prefer analog 
task-management systems (i.e., pen and paper) to get tasks out of their 
heads. To name but a few possibilities: Moleskine planners (with Evernote 
integration), the bullet journal setup... and a very stimulating view on 
pencil and paper in Nick Cernis' book, "The Todoodlist" I read earlier this 
year. A blank canvas has its appeal. You get to give form to your ideas - 
whether it's an art form or free-form task scribbling. We now have more 
options than ever to integrate the freedom that a blank canvas gives us, 
with the digital advantages of undo/ redo, zoom and tools/ effects that 
make the artistically or even technically challenged feel like pros. </description>

He fabricates nostalgic flashbacks of an alternative reality in the late '80s, where kids explore an impressive display of rusting Mechatronics scattered across the landscapes of rural Sweden:&nbsp;robots, &nbsp;androids, remnants of anti-gravity craft and abandoned scientific facilities - where we even get to witness the resurgence of dinosaurs.&nbsp;Please <em><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.simonstalenhag.se/">visit his site</a></strong></em>, where you will get the full treatment as you browse through a gallery of finely detailed images.&nbsp;Below you will see a few examples of Simon's work...&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>All images are copyrighted and used with kind permission of&nbsp;Simon Stålenhag:</em></p>

<h2 class="text-align-center">Evernote's Skitch - a canvas for your tasks</h2><p><span>What you will notice about this post, is that the notebook setup for our <em>Kanban Calendar</em> is fairly similar to that of the<strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.productivitymashup.com/blog/2014/10/7/kanban-calendar-evernote-series-1-of-5">1st post</a></strong> (<em>Intra-note based task-management</em>), with the exception that we will be using an Evernote tool called <em>Skitch</em>. Skitch exists </span><span>both&nbsp;</span><span>as a standalone app, as well as being integrated into the Evernote clients themselves. Here is w</span>hat makes this setup distinctive:</p><ul><li>This is the only way to <em><strong>drag and drop elements</strong></em>/ tasks within a note (image) in Evernote.&nbsp;</li><li>We can use the Skitch annotation tools to draw, annotate and <em><strong>create a layout exactly as we imagine it</strong>.</em><ul><li>We can also resize, highlight and change the color of a task.</li></ul></li><li>We are able to use just about <em><strong>any background image</strong></em> to annotate over. Even if you're only fractionally geeky, this opens up&nbsp;all kinds of possibilities... look out for my <em>Darth Vade</em>r background!</li><li>We have access to a gallery of images within a note in <strong><em>presentation </em></strong><em><strong>mode</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>transforming a vertically scrolling note into a horizontal gallery we can swipe through - akin to a typical&nbsp;<span><strong><em>Kanban layout</em>&nbsp;</strong>(</span><em>What is shown in the 1st video below is not presentation mode)</em>.</li><li>If you're into <em><strong>mind mapping</strong></em>, a big blank image is your playground. Plus you can also&nbsp;<span>zoom in and out of your canvas.</span></li></ul><h2 class="text-align-center">Guess the soundtrack...</h2><p>Watch the following video and take a peek into the world of <span>"</span><em>Image-based</em><span>"&nbsp;</span>task management, with Evernote's annotation tools. <em>Anyone care to guess where the accompanying soundtrack is from?</em></p><iframe scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/vNkUudLoKuk?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" width="640" frameborder="0" height="480">
</iframe><p>A quick tour of the 3 Kanban Calendar sections (iPad client):&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>The "<em>Projects</em>/ Backlogged" section</strong>, where projects and categories of tasks are collected.</li><li><strong>The "<em>Today</em>" Section</strong>, which has an&nbsp;<em>Eisenhower Matrix. </em>No&nbsp;"Doing" and&nbsp;"Done" stages this time 'round, since we can highlight the tasks we are currently working on and check them off with a sticker.&nbsp;In the 2nd half of the video, you'll also see a collection of Eisenhower Matrix templates - using Simon Stålenhag's artwork... as well as a few other miscellaneous galactic images.</li><li><strong>The "<em>Calendar</em>" section</strong>, with all up-and-coming date-specific tasks.&nbsp;Notice how when you tap on an image in mobile apps, you can flip through a gallery of all other images contained in that note.</li></ol><p> </p><p>Isn't it fantastically geeky&nbsp;(<em>geekily fantastic?</em>) that you get to scavenge any number of backgrounds from anywhere on the web?&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-align-center">Retro-futuristic tasks</h2><iframe scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/tM9jvPl7v2A?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" width="854" frameborder="0" height="480">
</iframe><p>If you look at today from tomorrow's perspective... and bring tomorrow's tasks into today - would that be <em>retro-futurism</em>? Probably not, but I'm going with it anyways. When you so much as glance at any up-and-coming tasks, you're catching a glimpse of your future - and hoping it's going to shape up the way you imagine. The future happens one day at a time. With that, let's get to our next brief video - brief enough to play a game of Pacman.&nbsp;</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_4_1414405125001_206725">In the Windows desktop client, one can select all elements within an image (Ctr-A) - We harvest the tasks from the next day in our Calendar section and paste them into today's Eisenhower Matrix.&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;<h2 class="text-align-center">Let's tie up some loose ends...</h2><p>Here are a couple of odds and ends you might like to know about the above setup:</p><ul><li>Here's a <em><strong>public notebook</strong></em> you can join and tinker with:&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.evernote.com/pub/frankman777/kanbancalendarskitch"><strong>https://www.evernote.com/pub/frankman777/kanbancalendarskitch</strong></a><ul><li>There, you will find all the notes seen in the videos, plus some fresh, clean templates.</li><li><p>What you want to do in order to have your own&nbsp;<em>editable&nbsp;</em>copy of the notes in the public notebook I shared with you is:&nbsp;<strong>(i)</strong>&nbsp;Follow the link provided&nbsp;and join the notebook.<em>&nbsp;</em><strong>(ii)</strong>&nbsp;Go to your Evernote account on desktop and sync.&nbsp;<strong>(iii)</strong>&nbsp;Create and name your own notebook.&nbsp;<strong>(iv)</strong>&nbsp;Go back to the<em>&nbsp;joined notebook</em>&nbsp;and select all of the notes in that notebook (Ctrl + A on Windows).&nbsp;<strong>(v)&nbsp;</strong>Right click on your selection and select&nbsp;"<em><strong>Copy&nbsp;</strong>to Notebook...</em>"&nbsp;&nbsp;("<em>Move to Notebook...</em>" will not work) and select the notebook you just created.&nbsp;<strong>(vi)</strong>&nbsp;You can then go ahead and delete the joined notebook, which will remove all of the original&nbsp;notes.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><span>You could easily set up <em><strong>Kanban stages</strong></em> instead of an Eisenhower Matrix if you wish. It's a cinch with the Skitch annotation tools.</span></li><li><span>If you're a premium Evernote user, you will also have access to <em><strong>Note History</strong></em>&nbsp;- keep in mind that this is a great tool for taking a peek pack in time at any single note and the contents thereof - under any given date your notes were modified. <em>This includes images</em>.&nbsp;</span></li><li>If you create your own template and copy multiple of the same image into a note (<em>for the Project or Calendar sections</em>), be aware that when you annotate one image, all images are annotated simultaneously. To avoid this, some kind of editing/ differentiating change needs to happen prior to a duplicate image being inserted into the same note.<ul><li>On desktop you can right click on an image + "<em>Annotate a copy of this image</em>"... then drag and drop the edited image back into the original note.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>On desktop:&nbsp;Shift-click-click - to select and move, copy, delete or edit <em>multiple items</em>.</li><li>Whatever you do, <em><strong>do not rotate an image</strong></em> that has been annotated:&nbsp;the annotations become permanent fixtures/ part of the image. Other than that, you can even copy-paste the images elsewhere, including dragging to your desktop - and the annotations will still be editable thereafter.</li><li>Copy-pasting elements (tasks) between images with markedly different widths will make those elements appear smaller/ larger when transferred. These can, of course, be adjusted. However, if you'd like to keep things uniform across the board, aim to use images that all have roughly the same width. All of the images in the public notebook provided (seen in the video) have a width of 1000 pixels. Thus, I have no issues with format changes. You can re-size an image in Adobe Illustrator, flickr, online, etc... or you can use mine. But I have a feeling you'll all have different tastes!</li></ul><hr />]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Kanban Calendar: Evernote Series - 2 of 5</title>

      <description>Often, a bridge between two universes allows for a crossing over... and 
Evernote's Reminders feature (that little blue or green alarm clock) is the 
bridge to our parallel universe - the Reminders list. We'll be looking at 
multiple ways of getting our tasks into that list with no 
fuss. The Reminders list becomes more than just an interesting mock-up of 
our notes that have embedded Reminders. The Reminders list is similar (yet 
different) to our lists of notebooks and notes. In this universe, the law 
of dragging and dropping is part of its very fabric - allowing us to sort 
our tasks and also transfer them between notebooks with ease - making for 
yet another great Kanban Calendar setup.</description>

<p><span>There are both similarities <em>and </em>differences in parallel universes. </span></p><ul><li><span>In the <em>Doctor Who</em> episode,&nbsp;"<em>Rise of the Cybermen</em>", the UK was instead the<em>&nbsp;People's Republic of Great Britain, complete&nbsp;</em>with floating zeppelins. </span></li><li><span>In <em>The Fringe</em>, <em>Walter Bishop</em> was an eccentric and socially awkward scientist, while his counterpart, "<em>Walternate</em>", the self-assured U.S. Secretary of Defense. </span></li><li><span>In the <em>Star Trek</em> episode, "<em>Mirror, Mirror</em>", Mr. Spock's doppelgänger sported a game-changing goatee.</span></li></ul><p> </p><p><span>Often, a&nbsp;</span>bridge&nbsp;<span>between two universes allows for a crossing over... and Evernote's <strong><em>Reminders&nbsp;</em><em>feature </em></strong>(that little blue or green alarm clock)<em>&nbsp;</em>is the bridge to our parallel universe - <strong><em>the Reminders list</em></strong>. </span><span>We'll be looking at multiple ways of getting our tasks into that list with no fuss</span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;The&nbsp;</span><span>Reminders list becomes <em>more </em>than just an interesting mock-up of our notes that have embedded Reminders. The Reminders list is similar (yet different) to our lists of notebooks and notes. In this&nbsp;</span><span>universe, the law of <em>dragging and dropping</em> is part of its very fabric - allowing us to sort our tasks and also transfer them between notebooks with ease - making for yet another great Kanban Calendar setup.</span></p>

<h2 class="text-align-center"><span>Take me to your... errr, Reminders list</span></h2><p><span>You can access the <em>Reminders list</em> through a drop-down menu pinned to the top of your note list (middle panel) in the desktop client and by tapping on the alarm clock in the mobile device clients, in whatever context. In your Reminders list, &nbsp;you can reorder notes within a notebook by&nbsp;</span><span>dragging and dropping -</span><span>&nbsp;and specifically on the <em>desktop </em>client, you can also drag and drop from one notebook to another - both in the Reminders list itself, as well as to any notebook whatsoever in the Stack and Notebook list in the leftmost panel, otherwise brilliantly named... <em>T</em><em>he </em><em>Left Panel</em>.</span></p><p>When one creates a reminder, there is the option to <em>add a date</em>. For the purposes of Kanban Calendar, we'll not to need to set a date or receive any notifications. We're just going to set "<em>simple</em>" reminders initially, so that notes simply appear in the Reminders list, displayed under their respective notebooks.&nbsp;</p><p><em>The soundtrack in the following video comes from the hauntingly beautiful theme song of the TV series, "Fringe"...</em></p><iframe scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0rAPn6EFqNI?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" width="854" frameborder="0" height="480">
</iframe><p><span>In the video (</span><em>desktop&nbsp;</em><span><em>client)</em>, you will see that I have set up&nbsp;</span><span>the 3 Kanban Calendar sections in separate &nbsp;<em><strong>stacks</strong>, </em>each housing several notebooks:</span></p><ul><li><em><strong>Backlogged </strong>stack -</em>&nbsp;Projects and categories.</li><li><em><strong>Today </strong>stack -<strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>&nbsp;Eisenhower Matrix, Doing, Done and Inbox.</li><li><em><strong>Calendar </strong>stack</em>&nbsp; - At least a month's worth of dates.</li></ul><p>Notice how you can drag and drop a task (reminder) anywhere you want, as well as create tasks from within the Reminders list.</p><p> </p><h2 class="text-align-center">Bridging the gap with reminders</h2><p>We don't spend our lives in Evernote. We hang out in our email inboxes. We surf the web. We tinker with other apps. There are countless ways to get our stuff into Evernote from the outside. How about getting task-related material into our Reminders list - from the outside? In the next video, I show but a few ways of getting tasks into the Reminders list from external sources.&nbsp;</p><p><em><span>Enjoy the accompanying theme song from LOST, "</span>Life and Death<span>".</span></em></p><iframe scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/N7_h4cGAR88?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" width="854" frameborder="0" height="480">
</iframe><p>At least 4 distinct ways to create Evernote reminders externally:</p><ol><li>Use the Evernote Web Clipper to clip screenshots, articles and emails (and add a reminder while you're at it).</li><li>Send an email directly to Evernote, creating a reminder by including an "!" at the end of the subject line.</li><li>Use a 3rd party Evernote app such as "<em>SnapEntry</em>" for iOS and include a reminder before sending.</li><li>Tap on the alarm clock icon in "<em>Today View</em>" in the <span>iOS</span>&nbsp;Notification Center as a shortcut to directly creating a reminder in Evernote.</li></ol><p> </p><ul><li>Above, I send all the reminders to my default Evernote inbox... but in each case, there is a way to send them to a notebook of your choice - so if you know the specific notebook you'd like to send them to, by all means, send them directly there from the get-go.</li><li>Here is the <a target="_blank" href="https://evernote.com/contact/support/kb/#!/article/23480523"><strong>syntax </strong></a>for forwarding emails to your Evernote address (especially useful on mobile devices).</li><li>The tasks/ reminders you send to your default Evernote inbox will be distinguishable from the rest of your notes therein, since they are in the Reminders list. From there, to sort your tasks, it's a simple case of dragging and dropping to whatever notebook.</li></ul><h2 class="text-align-center">And a couple more pointers...</h2><ul><li>If you're going to set up your task management system anything similar to the one shown above, you will need to have about 50 notebooks (out of a max of 250 personal notebooks) available. If on the other hand you have a business account, you'll have a 5,000-notebook limit. On top of that, you still get to join 100 (Free) / 250 (Premium) shared or public notebooks.</li><li>While you cannot share stacks, conceivably, in a team ecosystem, you should be able to share/ join all of the notebooks contained therein. And once in your account, you can nestle them in re-created stacks, mirroring the originals.</li><li>You can use Evernote tags... or else tag your tasks with @ and # in the note (task) titles - that's if you're into GTD contexts.&nbsp;</li><li><em><span>By the way - to see your reminders according to notebook categories, you're going to need to uncheck "</span>Sort Reminders by Date<span>" in the Reminders list&nbsp;</span>sort menu</em><span>.</span></li></ul><h2 class="text-align-center">Alphabetizing/ sorting</h2><ul><li>A lot of the head scratching and tinkering for this post was done in an attempt to get the stacks and notebooks into the right logical order, while still looking half decent. Suffice to say that there is a predetermined order in which all ASCII characters are displayed - so you have to try a mix of numbers, letters, characters and spacing.&nbsp;</li><li>Here are the characters I used:<ul><li><span>• &nbsp; &nbsp; (Alt 7)</span></li><li><span>♫ &nbsp; &nbsp;(Alt 14)</span></li><li>► &nbsp; (Alt 16)</li><li>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Alt 62)</li><li>@ &nbsp; &nbsp;(Alt 64)</li><li><span>| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Alt 124)</span></li><li><span>▄ &nbsp; (Alt 220)&nbsp;</span></li><li>■ &nbsp; &nbsp;(Alt 254<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></li></ul></li></ul><p>Feel free to chime in with your thoughts in the comments below. If you're into Kanban and Evernote, &nbsp;I hope I've given you a lot of food for thought. I still quite like my <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.productivitymashup.com/blog/2014/7/29/kanbana-app-jarvis?q=kanbana">Kanbana setup</a>&nbsp;</strong>for iOS<strong>,</strong>&nbsp;though.</p><p> </p><hr />]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Kanban Calendar: Evernote Series - 1 of 5</title>

      <description>"The interior of a TARDIS is much larger than its exterior, which can blend 
in with its surroundings using the ship's "chameleon circuit". In the 
series, the Doctor pilots an obsolete Type 40 TARDIS. Its chameleon circuit 
is broken, leaving it [the exterior] stuck in the shape of a 1960s-style 
London police box after its visit there in 1963." - Wikipedia 

Of course, the interior of a note (note body) is vastly bigger than the 
exterior (note title). We're going to leverage Evernote's ability to house 
tailor-made expandable tables and lists. In this first post, I'll be 
showcasing Evernote's ability to house the 3 component sections of the 
Kanban Calendar system in individual notes - an entire section in one note. 
Actually, the whole bang shoot could be housed in one note - but I'd like 
to take advantage of some cool features Evernote has... </description>

<p>Since 1963, 12 actors have taken on the role of the Doctor. Unlike in the James Bond series, the transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show, with the&nbsp;Doctor periodically regenerating his appearance into a new&nbsp;body (a life process of&nbsp;Time Lords).</p><p>As such, over the next 5 weeks, &nbsp;I'm going to give you 5 drastically different incarnations of the selfsame Kanban Calendar system in Evernote, each with their own strengths, flavor, visual appeal and practicality.</p>

In the following video clip (<em>in Evernote's</em><em>&nbsp;iPad client</em>), after following a note link, I hit the <em>back arrow</em> to take me back to<em> point A</em>. Here are 4 things I link to in the video:</p><ol><li><em><strong>A complex project</strong></em>&nbsp;with its own Kanban workflow (<em>My blog setup</em>).</li><li><strong><em>A </em>"<em>Don't break the chain!</em>"</strong> <strong>calendar</strong>, using Evernote's annotation tools.</li><li><em><strong>An eBook</strong></em> in PDF format, where I can see a summary of annotations made in Evernote.</li><li><em><strong>Documents</strong></em>/ images taken with the Evernote <em>document camera</em> on mobile devices.</li></ol><p> </p><ul><li>You could also link to emails you've mailed in to Evernote, bills to pay that you've scanned in, web clippings that pertain to a project, hand-written lists that Evernote can index and make searchable with its OCR technology... etc.</li></ul><h2 class="text-align-center">The future - one day at a time</h2><p class="text-align-center"><em>(Soundtrack: Doctor Who, Series 6 - "The Majestic Tale")</em></p><iframe scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/RTdr1MobGN4?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" width="640" frameborder="0" height="480">
</iframe><ul><li>Once every 24 hours... tomorrow becomes today. So... we grab the tasks from the very next day in our <em>Calendar </em>section and bring them into our <em>Today </em>section. From there, they get distributed among whatever <em>priority stages</em> you've mapped out. I like the <em>Eisenhower Matrix</em>. Once you've done that, you can go ahead and delete that day in the Calendar section.&nbsp;</li><li>In this video clip, I double-click on a note in the list to expand it into it's own adjustable window (Windows desktop). You could open up one of these windows for each section if you like. Here I just navigate via my note links in the header.</li><li><strong>If you're a premium user, you get "<em>Note History</em>", which allows you to retrieve the <em>same note</em> at any previous date... thus, no archiving of completed tasks necessary!

I also made it so that the left and right borders are&nbsp;fixed. Only the bottom borders expand as you add to your lists.&nbsp;</li><li>In the Calendar section, I have created a <em><strong>gradient effect</strong></em> with the filler colors. The date headers get darker each week, so one gets a visual feel for how close you're getting to the end of the month.&nbsp;</li><li>When you first set your system up, I recommend <em><strong>duplicating</strong></em> the <em>Month Template</em>, and thereafter copy-pasting the contents of the original into your working Calendar section whenever you need a new set of 28-31 days. You shouldn't need more than 2 months at any given time.&nbsp;</li><li>I have included<em><strong> thumbnail images</strong></em>, out of the way, at the foot of each note. They are great visual cues, especially in&nbsp;<em>snippet&nbsp;view</em>.&nbsp;</li><li>I suggest adding your Kanban Calendar Notebook to the <em><strong>s</strong></em><strong><em>hortcut list </em></strong>for quick access, no matter where you are in Evernote.</li><li>I don't personally use a task "<em><strong>inbox</strong></em>". If you'd like one, you could create your inbox in a new note... or you could keep new incoming tasks in an <em>inbox section</em> in your project section/ note.</li></ol><iframe scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/OrFpjh4KF4U?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" width="854" frameborder="0" height="480">

capitalistic race from the planet Ferenginar. A Ferengi's entire existence

<h2 class="text-align-center">Select what you want and disregard the rest</h2><p>Dare I mention how frequently the extraneous stuff kicks our butts? It kicks us to the curb of unproductivity - no chance of saving face. Melodramatic? Maybe - but I'm sure you've been left with that bad aftertaste of uselessness in your mouth... more than once. Each and every day it's a challenge to keep the less than optimal at bay. Here are but a few ways I deal with distractions/ extraneous stuff:</p><h2 class="text-align-center">1. Hash out &amp; plan the addictive</h2><p>Who doesn't like a good TV series? How many can you keep up with simultaneously? At some point we're going to have to make some tough decisions. Not cut them out, but whittle it down to our top pics (not top 10!). One fantastically entertaining series, <em>The Walking Dead</em>, was the first on my list to go. I reasoned with and convinced myself (after some extensive research) that a zombie apocalypse really has no fairy-tale ending. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. I figured that things were not even going to get worse before they got any better. I was just as reluctant as a hoarder is to throw out something so near and dear to me... but it had to be done. Step 2: plan my viewing - Enter <a target="_blank" href="http://episodecalendar.com/"><em><strong>e</strong></em><em><strong>pisodecalendar.com</strong></em></a>. The free EpisodeCalendar allows you to send yourself email notifications the day before, on the day or the day after a new episode of any of your favorite TV series comes out. That way I can plan what I'm going to watch, and don't have this ominous feeling that I'm missing out on something.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-align-center">2. My love triangle: Zite, Pocket &amp;&nbsp;Evernote&nbsp;</h2><p>I love flipping through my news aggregator, Zite. I give myself just 7 minutes to flip through to the end. I'm on a mission to cherry-pick any article that may be of real value to me and send it to my read-it-later app, <em>Pocket</em>. No messing around. At a more convenient time, I settle in and read those articles in "<em>article view</em>", which strips out any ads and extraneous stuff. The same can be done with the Evernote web clipper's "simplified article" view or <em>Evernote Clearly</em>. In fact, whatever I see whilst surfing the net for something in specific... if I come across anything cool, but not in line with what I'm focusing on, I either send it to Evernote for filing or to Pocket for later reading. We have to get selective and even very picky with the stuff that constantly vies for our attention - for our precious time. In that light, if you've selectively chosen to follow my blog through email updates, I am honored... but by all means, save a post to Pocket/ Instapaper/ Evernote (or wherever) and get back to it later.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-align-center">3.To unfollow or not to unfollow...</h2><p>Recently I've been hiding a lot of my "friends" on Facebook, and keeping those people in my feed that, well... feed me. &nbsp;Get selective.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-align-center">4. Quite frankly my dear... I'm in the middle of a Pomodoro</h2><p>Ever heard of time-boxing or the Pomodoro Technique? It's focus 101. Beat back any and all distractions during a time-boxed period. I aim for 25 minutes. Shut the door, put your mobile device into silent mode and turn it face-down. Only specific things - like bubblegum in my daughter's hair - have been known to break my Pomodori. You be the judge of that.</p><h2 class="text-align-center">5. Nip it in the bud - unsubscribe</h2><p>Unsubscribe/ unfollow blogs and especially forum threads that start to be a drain on your time. Ask yourself if participating in any online discussion is going to add anything to your day. Just moments ago I unfollowed an Evernote forum thread that was beginning to irritate me.</p><h2 class="text-align-center">6. Put off until tomorrow what you shouldn't do today</h2><p>Let me leave you with one more gem: If you own an iOS device or a Mac, you will thank me later... Dropbox's sublime email client, <em>Mailbox</em>, allows you to schedule certain emails and have them reenter your inbox at the time of your choice. I use Mailbox on my iPhone and iPad...and "Boomerang" on my Windows desktop. It helps you to cut through the "<em>visual frenzy</em>", as Captain Jean-Luc Picard so graphically puts it.</p><p>If you've got anything to add to this post (Surely there must be something!), please join or start the conversation below in the comments. If you deem it to be an unprofitable use of your time, as would the Ferengi, no worries. Until next time!</p><hr />]]></content:encoded>

You tackle all of those tasks one at a time without wasting any effort - no restarts, no mistakes. All green lights. We simply do the perfect set of activities each day, one after the other. Why can't our paths to success and&nbsp;&nbsp;happiness&nbsp;&nbsp;be lined up in this way, one doable task at a time? I'm sure you could tell me a couple of reasons why this would not be the most ideal - especially the fact that we often learn from and grow as a result of our mistakes. But can we get our lives to line up <em>something </em>like this? Just a teeny tiny bit? Sure... it depends on your prioritization system. It also depends on what you want out of life.</p><p>Here's one aspect of things lining up for us: <em>Recurring tasks</em>. They're mostly a required part of our routine... and then there are those tasks or activities we <em>choose </em>to make part of our routine. We're going to take a super quick look at the idea of recurring tasks, and how one might slot them into your task-management system... but just to peek into another perspective, watch the following 1-minute Star Trek (TNG) video I clipped, just for you -&nbsp;<em>Throwback Thursday</em> style:&nbsp;</p>

These recurring tasks play one of the biggest roles in shaping our habits - and therefore our success. They are either plotted on a calendar, programmed to recur automatically in our task management app of choice... or we lay them out manually in whatever app, shape or form.</p>&nbsp;<h2 class="text-align-center">Slow and steady wins the race</h2><p>Haha, as I write this, I just got interrupted with a <em>Duolingo </em>notification on my lock screen: "<em>Learning a language requires a little practice every day. Practice your Portuguese on Duolingo</em>." Actually, I have a recurring task set up in Kanbana (iOS app) to remind me of that. It doesn't repeat on its own. I make it repeat by manually dragging and dropping it to the next day on my Kanban board. And the show goes on.&nbsp;</p><p>"Recurring reminders" is probably the #1 feature request. App developers get harassed day and night to roll them out yesterday - and for good reason. Here are 3 ways I deal with recurring tasks:</p><ol><li>I have created my own task-management system, and much prefer dragging and dropping my recurring tasks to the next due date on my Kanban board, whether it be a daily, weekly or monthly recurring task... and one day at a time, my tasks "<em>stream towards</em>" me:&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.productivitymashup.com/blog/2014/7/29/kanbana-app-jarvis"><em>http://www.productivitymashup.com/blog/2014/7/29/kanbana-app-jarvis</em></a></li><li>I like to automate a couple of tasks in iOS reminders, since I have my iPhone with me most of the time. I have one or two tasks that I like to be alerted about at specific times. Every day at 9:30 pm I get a reminder to floss my teeth. It starts like this: <em>Floss teeth (</em><em><strong>0</strong>/100)</em>. Each day I floss my teeth, I edit the reminder as follows: <em>Floss teeth (</em><strong>1</strong><em>/100)</em>. That motivates me to not break the chain. Before long, these types of things become automatic.&nbsp;</li><li>for a couple of things that are not that urgent, such as watering my plants, I use a free email reminder service called "<em>Followupthen</em>". You simply email the service, including the time parameters in the address line: <em>everytuesdayandthursday@followupthen.com</em>, and add the task to be reminded about into the subject line: <em>Water the plants!</em></li></ol><p><em>I'm very much interested in how you smart folk out there go about automating or dealing with your recurring tasks.

      <description>This edition of my Kanban Calendar setup showcases Trello, one of the 
heavyweights in the task management world. With multiple Kanban boards, 
sublists within individual cards and the ability to create multiple cards 
at once from any input list, it is similar to the previously reviewed 
Kanbana app, only a bit more souped up. If you're a Star Trek fan and a 
Kanban enthusiast, this post is a match made in heaven. What are the 
chances?</description>

What are the chances?</span></p><h2 class="text-align-center">Saucer separation - primary and secondary hulls</h2><blockquote><span>A day or two ago I watched Star Trek (TNG) Season 1 Episode 20, "</span><em>T</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em> </em><em>A</em><em>r</em><em>s</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>a</em><em>l</em><em> </em><em>o</em><em>f</em><em> </em><em>F</em><em>r</em><em>e</em><em>e</em><em>d</em><em>o</em><em>m</em><span>". In this episode the Starship Enterprise comes under attack from a cloaked (invisible) sentry probe while in orbit around the planet of Minos. This is one of the few episodes where we see the USS Enterprise decouple the primary and secondary hull, in an emergency maneuver called </span><em>s</em><em>a</em><em>u</em><em>c</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em> </em><em>s</em><em>e</em><em>p</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>a</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>o</em><em>n</em><span>. This allowed civilians to remain aboard the saucer section, while the main crew took the secondary hull back to take on the sentry probe and extract the away team from Minos. </span></blockquote>

<p><span>Saucer separation happens for 3 main reasons:</span></p><ul><li><span>To separate the civilians from the main crew in emergency situations</span></li><li><span>To focus full energy reserves on a battle</span></li><li><span>Agility</span></li></ul>

      <description>WorkFlowy has an effect on us akin to the "Tetris Effect". Besides that... 
it's downright addictive. I've taken to using my notebook more these days 
for one reason: I can't get enough of WorkFlowy's speed on desktop.

There are limitless possibilities as to the way we can stack all pieces around one another. Every piece is vital and either contributes to the bigger picture... or screws things up for us. And when you get into the flow, there's nothing that can stop you.&nbsp;</span></span></em></li></ul><p><span>I'd like to expand on my <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.productivitymashup.com/blog/2014/8/17/kanban-calendar-workflowy">previous post</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>on setting up the Kanban Calendar System in WorkFlowy.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>A number of people have voiced the following comment in similar ways:</span></p><blockquote><em><span>"Frank, Your kanban/workflowy method seems quite interesting. However, transferring tasks into the Kanban today/calendar forever dissociates them from their respective projects. With this system, it seems you cannot review progress (completed items) on a project in order to plan the next steps. This seems like a major limitation at least to me. If you have any workarounds, I would be glad to hear them, thx."</span></em></blockquote><p>The nifty thing about the Kanban Calendar setup is that it is predominantly a <em><strong>global board</strong></em> which brings all "free radical" and miscellaneous tasks into a common arena. However, a very pertinent point, (to be a tad melodramatic) as the above cry for help suggests: what about the actual workflow of individual, complex projects? How do we keep all those related project tasks together <em>and <strong>give them their own tailor-made workflow</strong></em>, but at the same time include them in the <em>Today </em>list/ workflow?</p><p>If we extract individual project tasks to our <em>Today </em>section or even the <em>Calendar </em>section, we are taking them out of the context of their workflow. It then becomes increasingly difficult or even impossible to visualize them &nbsp;as part of any meaningful workflow, according to the classical Kanban dynamic. Then it's no longer Kanban, really. The Kanban Calendar is not a typical Kanban setup. So how do we embed the classical Kanban workflow into our Kanban board... into the grand scheme of things? WorkFlowy has a knack for that.</p><p>The video clip below should give you a clear visual cue as to the possibilities at our disposal. Let's say I wanted to include my <em>Blog setup</em> in my Kanban Calendar. There were scores of tasks I needed to complete to finally launch my blog. Tons of little details. What I want to achieve is to <em><strong>represent </strong></em>that project in my <em>Today </em>section, right there alongside bills to pay and all of life's other demands, plus the things I choose to focus on today.</p><p>Keep an eye out for the 3 ways to get to the Kanban workflow &nbsp;for my Blog setup from the<em>Today </em>section, starting with the "long" way and ending off with the ridiculously short way:</p><iframe scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/zV4t8na3W4I?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" width="640" frameborder="0" height="480">
</iframe><ol><li>Access the Project section on the main Kanban board and zoom into the #BLOG SETUP project list.</li><li><em><strong>OR</strong></em> - Tap/ click on the #BLOG tag in the header of the main Kanban board and zoom in to the #BLOG SETUP project list in the simplified list.</li><li><em><strong>OR</strong></em> - On desktop/ web: click on the STAR icon next to the search bar. This is the shortcut menu, where you will find any lists you had previously "favorited". Simply click on any project you wish to access.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>If you'd like to tinker around with this template, be my guest:&nbsp;<strong><a target="_blank" href="https://workflowy.com/s/CiPqAWhLCt">https://workflowy.com/s/CiPqAWhLCt</a></strong></p><p>In the video clip, notice how the Kanban workflow for my Blog setup included its own unique stages:</p><ul><li>Backlogged, Working On, Waiting, Later, Done, Resolved.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Come to think of it, my "Waiting On" and "Later" stages could be grouped with backlogged tasks... however, for some reason, I feel comfortable with those categories sitting where they are. On the whole, there is a progression from Backlogged to Done/ Resolved.&nbsp;</p><p>You can create any stages you wish in individual and unique project workflows. It all depends on the nature of the project. You decide on that. I recommend reading up on the Personal Kanban concept in general. It's worth delving into.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-align-center">A shoutout&nbsp;</h2><p>The organizational inspiration for the GTD-like tag and context index comes directly from Karl Rohde's post, "<a target="_blank" href="http://worklikeanartist.com/blog/workflowy"><em><strong>How I use WorkFlowy to do my best work</strong></em></a>" on his blog,&nbsp;<em><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://worklikeanartist.com/">Work Like an Artist</a></strong></em>:</p>

<h2 class="text-align-center">Tetris bonus round</h2><p><strong><span>Here's something I mostly lifted from Wikipedia: </span></strong></p><p><span>"<em>There have been studies indicating that even moderate playing of Tetris (half-an-hour a day for three months) boosts general cognitive functions such as critical thinking, <span>&nbsp;</span>reasoning, language and processing and increases cerebral cortex&nbsp;thickness</em>". </span></p><p><span>Could it be that WorkFlowy does something similar?</span></p><p><strong><span>Also, here's something I lifted directly from my WorkFlowy outline:</span></strong></p><ul><li><span>Try this 90-day challenge for Productivity's sake:</span><ol><li><span>Put&nbsp;the following task structure into your Kanban&nbsp;Calendar's <em>Today </em>section&nbsp;</span><span><em>(Possibly #2 - Not urgent &amp; Important)&nbsp;</em>: </span><ul><li><strong><span>Tetris [1/90]</span></strong><ul><li><em><strong>http://www.freetetris.org/</strong></em></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><span>Each day for a period of 90 days, simply follow the link and play Tetris for 30 minutes (<em>or 3 sets of 10 minutes throughout your day</em>). Guess what... That's a Pomodoro more or less! </span></li><li><span>At the end of each day, recycle the task from your "<em>Done</em>" stage - and when you complete it once again the next day, modify your task to: </span><ul><li><strong>Tetris [2/90]</strong><ul><li><em><strong>http://www.freetetris.org/</strong></em></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Repeat this little hack <span>until you complete your 90 days - and feel a whole bunch smarter - and better about yourself, for having followed through with a 3-month challenge. In fact, this can be done in building any habit or sticking to any long-term project. I did this when I dragged and dropped 17,965 comic strips into my Evernote account over a period of 100 days to create my own private <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.productivitymashup.com/blog/2014/8/23/geeky-database-evernote">geeky database</a></strong>.</span></li></ol></li><li><span>Or you could just tinker around with WorkFlowy if you're not <em>all </em>kinds of geeky. </span></li></ul><hr />]]></content:encoded>

      <description>There are many apps that have multiple latent functions and are flexible 
enough to take on both your tasks and your creative work. A gorgeously 
minimalistic writing app for iOS, Daedalus Touch - the self-dubbed "World's 
Sexiest Writing App" - is one such candidate.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Some prefer to manage their tasks in WorkFlowy simply because they do a lot of outlining and writing there. Others prefer Evernote for their to-do lists because that's where their reference/ project material is, while some smart academics may use Gingko app because they outline their papers there and want to have quick access to their tasks. There are many apps that have multiple latent functions and are flexible enough to take on both your tasks and your creative work.

<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1409468582694_277390" class="text-align-center">Reimagine&nbsp;</h2><p><span>If your main thing is writing, why not use a writing app to house your tasks? In sticking to the 2 core Kanban principles: (1) <em>Visualize your workflow</em> and (2) <em>Limit your work in progress</em>, this post showcases Daedalus Touch's ability to be a serious contender in my Kanban Calendar task management system. <strong><a target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.productivitymashup.com/blog/2014/7/17/kanban-calendar-preamble" href="http://www.productivitymashup.com/blog/2014/7/17/kanban-calendar-preamble">Read about the basics here</a></strong>. Also<strong>, <a target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.productivitymashup.com/?tag=Kanban+Calendar" href="http://www.productivitymashup.com/?tag=Kanban+Calendar">see examples of other apps here</a></strong>. As in previous posts - and many to come - we can reinvent a new incarnation of Personal Kanban, now in Daedalus Touch. Even if you're not at all inclined to use this app for task management, let a little something different inspire you to new ways of doing things - or at least pique your curiosity.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Daedalus Touch is all about unlimited sets of <em>sheets </em>within <em>paper stacks</em>. It's about flipping through your individual sheets and stacks at breakneck warp speed. It's all about using iOS gestures to the max to zoom into and out of wherever you want. I sometimes just open Daedalus to flip through and tinker. That's how addictive it is.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1409468582694_77560"><span>In&nbsp;Greek mythology,&nbsp;Daedalus&nbsp;("to work artfully"), was a skilled Athenian&nbsp;craftsman and artist. Notably, he was also the father of Icarus. He fashioned two pairs of wings out of wax and feathers for himself and his son. What I wanted to point out is that besides crafting workable wearable wings for both himself and Icarus, Daedalus is also mentioned by Homer as being the architect behind the Labyrinth on Crete in which the Minotaur was kept, as well as<em> </em>masterminding the masts and sails for the navy of Minos (to name just a couple of achievements).</span></p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1409468582694_77561"><span>In Homer's language, <em>daidala&nbsp;</em>are finely crafted objects. Not only is the writing app, Daedalus Touch, a finely crafted work of art in itself, but is also, in the same vein, a beautifully practical app within which to house your creative writing. We're going to see how it can also house your lists of tasks... and how one can effortlessly zoom in and out of different paper stacks within the app, unlike the impossibly difficult Labyrinth on Crete. Daedalus Touch gives us the ability to get a sweeping bird's-eye view - Kanban Calendar style.</span></p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1409468582694_77562"><span>To help us navigate the Labyrinth of ideas we have constantly streaming into our minds and to get unstuck, Daedalus Touch provides us with a metaphorical ball of thread - iOS gestures that allow us to pinch to zoom out of sheets and stacks to see the bigger picture... and then hone in on another paper stack and its <em>gallery </em>of sheets.</span></p>&nbsp;<h2 class="text-align-center">A gallery of sheets for our Kanban Calendar</h2><iframe scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/PcRM3x9g3wo?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" width="640" frameborder="0" height="480">
</iframe><p>You will notice that this edition of Kanban Calendar closely resembles the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.productivitymashup.com/blog/2014/7/29/kanbana-app-jarvis"><strong>Kanbana app</strong></a> I featured a few weeks ago. Instead of panels, we now have sheets. Instead of dragging and dropping, one now cuts and pastes. One interesting difference in Daedalus Touch is that each day in the calendar section now includes an Eisenhower priority matrix. This helps us to give a little thought to each task we transfer or input.</p><p>As you take a look at the video clip, you will see how Daedalus consists of as many sheets in as many stacks as you want to create. Another way of structuring the Kanban Calendar would be to create 2-3 stacks instead of just one. I prefer one consolidated stack. Either way, one is able to transfer any sheet to another stack by simply docking it to the bottom of the interface.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-align-center">The basic setup</h2><p>The video clip gives a general sweep of the entire Kanban Calendar setup. As always, there are 3 definitive sections:</p><ol><li><strong>A Backlogged/ Projects&nbsp;section </strong>for all unfinished projects and miscellaneous tasks, organized by category or context.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The Today section</strong>, including our prioritization stages. I like the Eisenhower Matrix. Others prefer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/a-better-todo-list-the-135-rule"><strong>the 1-3-5 rule</strong></a>, among others. &nbsp;Here one can also include the Kanban "<em>Doing</em>" and "<em>Done</em>" stages. Go to town on whatever stages you need to get the job done.</li><li><strong>A Calendar section</strong>:&nbsp;</li></ol><ul><li>Enabling us to <em>push </em>excessive tasks to, which would otherwise clutter up our day and our focus. This goes a long way in keeping our <em>Work In Progress</em> in the Today section manageable.&nbsp;</li><li>Notably, the main function of the Calendar section is to "<em>pull</em>" tasks into the <em>Today </em>section as each date comes around, one at a time: each day we transfer the tasks from the next day into the priority system we've got going for <em>To</em><em>day's </em>tasks.</li><li>Once any recurring weekly or monthly tasks are completed they can then also get pushed to the next due date in the calendar. This way, one does not have to set due dates for recurring tasks. It's hands-on all the way.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class="text-align-center">Complex projects - Kanban within Kanban Calendar</h2><p>You may have noticed in the video clip that one of the projects I had going was my blog setup. Each sheet in Daedalus Touch can become a Personal Kanban board in itself. The most basic stages one would have in Kanban would be: "<em>Backlogged</em>"/ "<em>To Do</em>", "<em>Doing</em>" and "<em>Done</em>". I also created:</p><ul><li>A "<em>Waiting</em>" for stage - For technical issues that only the Squarespace platform staff could resolve and get back to me on. Basically any <em>delegated </em>stuff that I had my hands tied on.</li><li>A "<em>Later</em>" stage - to help me separate tasks that did not need to be done before the launch of my blog. This helped me to put first things first.</li><li>A "Resolved" stage - any delegated tasks that had been completed.</li></ul><p>The above is a classic case of using the Personal Kanban system the way many recognize it. We don't want to stop there, though. We want to be able to tie in and consolidate multiple projects as well as miscellaneous daily tasks in a visual way. That's where the Kanban Calendar system comes in handy. It's visualizing the workflow of all of our stuff to do - not just for projects. What one does to achieve this, is simply to have any project(s) we are working on represented by the project's name in the Kanban Calendar. That will be our reference to an external/ separate task board for any particular project.</p><h2 class="text-align-center">A common thread of tags</h2><p>Since we're looking at a writing app here, there is a full-on search feature at out disposal, which also doubles up in the GTD department to narrow down our contexts and tags. In the video above you will have seen the #exp (expense) tag, which gives a search count on each stack cover&nbsp;<em>and </em>highlights all instances in each sheet for easily locating multiple tagged items wherever they may be. Plus we have a next/ previous button to jump to the next/ previous instance if we're not up to swiping or scrolling.</p><h2 class="text-align-center">Keeping your head about you</h2><p>One neat little trick we can do in Daedalus Touch, is to dock the "<em>Doing</em>" stage from the Today section of our Kanban Calendar to the bottom of the <em>sheet </em>gallery interface. It stays there no matter what stack we open, and is an ever-present, constant reminder of the one or two things we are (or should be) working on at any given time. In any Kanban system, the idea is to follow through with the parameters and guidelines we've set up - and in so doing, neither fly too high and too close to the sun (like the distracted Icaro) nor too low and too close to the ocean. We aim to work within what is reasonable and doable.&nbsp;</p><p>On a similar note... just to save some poor soul from typing out the Eisenhower matrix on every Calendar sheet - do yourself a favor and copy an entire template sheet and paste it on multiple sheets. Also, if you have an iPad or iPhone, you should be able to use Siri to dictate not only the date headers of each sheet... but also your tasks.</p><p>Last, but not least - The "<em>Soulmen</em>" have an app for Mac - <em>Ulysses </em>- which integrates with&nbsp;<em>D</em><em>aedalus Touch - </em>making this setup ubiquitous if you're an Apple fan.</p><p><center data-preserve-html-node="true"><span data-preserve-html-node="true">follow</span></center></p><nav class="sqs-svg-icon--list social-icon-alignment-center social-icons-color-black social-icons-size-small social-icons-shape-circle social-icons-style-knockout"><a href="https://twitter.com/ProMashUp" target="_blank" class="sqs-svg-icon--wrapper twitter"><svg viewBox="0 0 64 64" class="sqs-svg-icon--social"><use class="sqs-use--background" xlink:href="/universal/svg/social-accounts.svg#background"></use><use class="sqs-use--icon" xlink:href="/universal/svg/social-accounts.svg#twitter-icon"></use><use class="sqs-use--mask" xlink:href="/universal/svg/social-accounts.svg#twitter-mask"></use></svg></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/productivitymashup" target="_blank" class="sqs-svg-icon--wrapper facebook"><svg viewBox="0 0 64 64" class="sqs-svg-icon--social"><use class="sqs-use--background" xlink:href="/universal/svg/social-accounts.svg#background"></use><use class="sqs-use--icon" xlink:href="/universal/svg/social-accounts.svg#facebook-icon"></use><use class="sqs-use--mask" xlink:href="/universal/svg/social-accounts.svg#facebook-mask"></use></svg></a><a href="mailto:frankman777@gmail.com" target="_blank" class="sqs-svg-icon--wrapper email"><svg viewBox="0 0 64 64" class="sqs-svg-icon--social"><use class="sqs-use--background" xlink:href="/universal/svg/social-accounts.svg#background"></use><use class="sqs-use--icon" xlink:href="/universal/svg/social-accounts.svg#email-icon"></use><use class="sqs-use--mask" xlink:href="/universal/svg/social-accounts.svg#email-mask"></use></svg></a></nav><hr />]]></content:encoded>
